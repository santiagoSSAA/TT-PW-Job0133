# TT-PW-Job0133 🚀

This is the TT/PW exercise made in Python using FastAPI.

## Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.11 or higher 🐍
- `pip` package manager 📦

## Install the dependencies 📥

First, ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the app ▶️

To start the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

- **`app:app`**: The first `app` refers to the filename (`app.py`), and the second `app` refers to the FastAPI instance.
- **`--reload`**: Enables auto-reloading of the server when code changes are detected, which is useful during development.

## Access the API 🌐

Once the server is running, you can access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. The interactive API documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
